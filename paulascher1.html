                 <h3>The 1970s</h3>
                <p>In 1970, after graduating from the Tyler School of Graphic Design, Scher first started her career in graphic design, in the City of New York. This is when she first started to work for 'Random House', where she designed layouts of children's books. Years after this, Scher designed one of her first-ever album covers, 'The Boston' album cover, for her job as an art director at Atlantic Records. This is an early example of her first typographical work. This album cover expressed her interest in inter-fusing her like for pop culture and experimental typography. This iconic album cover is very successful to this day, 40 years later. This experimental approach became Scher's inspiration for many of her works later in life, especially in the 1990s. After her success with the album cover, she went on to create over 150 albums covers each year, for 8 years while working with CBS Records, at the age of 25.</p>

                 <h3>The 1980s</h3>
                <p>In 1982, Scher started experimenting with typography and focussing on illustrative imagery, after leaving CBS Records. To influence her typography, Scher used inspiration from Russian Constructivism, making her work very much abstract and experimental. At the time, her posters and other works consisted of bold colours such as yellows and reds and photomontages, while using a big, blocky typeface, known as 'Agency Gothic'. In 1984, Scher and Terry Koppel partnered up and established a new design studio, named 'Koppel & Scher'. Scher wanted to experience having her own clients and the challenges and pressures of owning her own business, to help her grow as a professional and experienced designer. Within this time Scher designed advertisements, packaging, and iconic posters for her clients, such as The New York Times, Tiffany & Co, and GQ. One of these posters was the 'Swatch' poster, which was created for Swatch watches, at the time. </p>

                 <h3>The 1990s</h3>
                <p>In 1991, Scher became the first-ever female to be given the principal position at the Pentagram. The Pentagram is a 'multi-disciplinary, independently-owned design studio' (Pentagram, n.d.). The designers within this group work hard to design products and packaging, websites, instalments, graphics, and exhibitions. The pentagram consists of 23 partners, who work together and independently. They are situated around the globe, such as in New York, London, and Berlin. Throughout her years working for Pentagram, the American designer, has produced iconic and revolutionary designs. These designs have been made for well known, famous brands and clients such as Microsoft, Disney, Coca-Cola, Adobe, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Metropolitan Opera. During these years, Scher became a very successful and well-known designer, winning many awards, including the Type Directors Club Medal, which she was the first ever women to receive the award and the Chrysler Award for Innovation, while also being named to the Art Directors Hall of Fame in 1998.</p>
